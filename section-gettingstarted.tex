\chapter{Getting Started}

\section{Documentation Conventions}

Items to be selected from a menu are displayed in \menustyle{monospace font}.

Multilevel menu paths are separated by a / character. For example, \menustyle{Attenuation / 1x} means to open the
\menustyle{Attenuation} submenu and select the \menustyle{1x} item.

If there are multiple options for a menu or configuration option, they are displayed in square brackets and separated
by a | character. For example, \menustyle{Move waveform to / Waveform Group [1|2]} means to select either
\menustyle{Waveform Group 1} or \menustyle{Waveform Group 2} from the \menustyle{Move waveform to}
menu.

This project is under active development and is not anywhere near feature complete! As a result, this document is
likely to refer to active bug or feature request tickets on the GitHub issue trackers. Issues are referenced as
repository:ticket, for example scopehal-apps:3.

\section{Host System Requirements}

All current development is performed on Linux operating systems (primarily Debian and Arch), although experimental (and
incomplete) Windows support is provided. glscopeclient uses gtkmm as the UI toolkit. Current development mostly uses
3.24 but any recent 3.x version should work.

Any 64-bit ARM or Intel processor should be able to run glscopeclient. If AVX2 support is present glscopeclient will
use special optimized versions of some signal processing functions, however AVX2 is not required. AVX512 is not
currently used.

A mouse with scroll wheel, or touchpad with scroll gesture support, is mandatory to enable full use of the UI. We may
explore alternative input methods for some UI elements in the future.

OpenGL 4.2 or later is required, as well as several extensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item GL_ARB_arrays_of_arrays (or OpenGL 4.3)
\item GL_ARB_compute_shader (or OpenGL 4.3)
\item GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object (or OpenGL 4.3)
\item GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate
\end{itemize}

The corresponding minimum hardware requirement is an AMD Radeon HD 5000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 6xx series discrete GPU, or
Intel Skylake or newer integrated GPU, plus suitably up-to-date drivers. On Linux with recent Mesa, Intel integrated
GPUs as old as Ivy Bridge may be used.

TODO: what AMD integrated/ARM GPUs started supporting GL 4.2.

To check for necessary graphics card support on Linux:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
glxinfo | grep GL_ARB_arrays_of_arrays
glxinfo | grep GL_ARB_compute_shader
glxinfo | grep GL_ARB_shader_storage_buffer_object
glxinfo | grep GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version string"
\end{lstlisting}

If OpenCL 1.2 or higher is present, some filters may make use of GPU acceleration. As of this writing the first
detected GPU is automatically used; there may be a way to select specific devices in the future.

The minimum RAM requirement to actually launch glscopeclient is relatively small (TODO: do some testing) however
history mode and deep captures can easily consume many GB of RAM. We suggest 8GB as a reasonable minimum, with 32 or
more encouraged for deep history.

\section{Instrument Support}

glscopeclient uses the libscopehal library to communicate with oscilloscopes, so any libscopehal-compatible hardware
should work with glscopeclient. See the \hyperref[sec:drivers]{Oscilloscope Drivers} section for more details on which
hardware is supported and how to configure specific drivers.

\section{Compilation}

glscopeclient can be compiled on both Linux and Windows, but the specific steps that have to be taken differ quite a
lot between these the two.

\subsection{Linux}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Install dependencies.

On Debian:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libglm-dev \
	libgtkmm-3.0-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev libyaml-cpp-dev \
	liblxi-dev texlive texlive-fonts-extra libglew-dev \
	catch2 libclfft-dev
\end{lstlisting}

On Ubuntu (Note 16.X not supported, requires 18.04 or later):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
	sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libglm-dev \
		libgtkmm-3.0-dev libsigc++-2.0-dev libyaml-cpp-dev \
		liblxi-dev texlive texlive-fonts-extra libglew-dev \
		libclfft-dev
	\end{lstlisting}
	
Installing Catch2:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
cd Catch2
git checkout v2.x
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
\end{lstlisting}

On Fedora:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
sudo dnf install gtkmm30-devel cmake pkg-config glm-devel \
	texlive libyaml-devel yaml-cpp-devel glew-devel \
	catch-devel
\end{lstlisting}

If you are using an older stable release (such as Debian Buster), you may need to install catch2 from source
(https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). Alternatively, you may pass -DBUILD\_TESTING=OFF to CMake to disable unit testing.

\pagebreak

\item Install FFTS library
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
git clone https://github.com/anthonix/ffts.git
cd ffts
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_SHARED=ON
make -j4
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}

\item OpenCL drivers

This section is WIP. The Arch wiki contains a good overview of the packages required for AMD, Intel, and Nvidia (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU).

Recommend installing `clinfo` to check OpenCL support on your machine.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
sudo apt install clinfo
\end{lstlisting}

AMD:

Download drivers from AMD's website (https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-amdgpu-unified-linux-20-20).
The commands show how to extract and run their driver. Current testing on Ubuntu 20.04 results in errors with APT unless the amdgpu-dkms package is removed after installation.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
cd ~/Downloads
tar -Jxvf amdgpu-pro-X.X-XX-ubuntu-X.X.tar.xz
cd ~/Downloads/amdgpu-pro-X.X-XX-ubuntu-X.X.tar.xz
./amdgpu-pro-install --opencl=legacy,pal --headless
....
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
sudo apt remove amdgpu-dkms
sudo apt autoremove
\end{lstlisting}


\item Build scopehal and scopehal-apps
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
git clone https://github.com/azonenberg/scopehal-apps.git --recurse-submodules
cd scopehal-apps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4
\end{lstlisting}

\item Install scopehal and scopehal-apps: right now, you don't. As of now, glscopeclient is intended to be run from the
glscopeclient source directory (src/glscopeclient). Anybody want to contribute and set up a proper install process?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Windows}

On Windows, we make use of the MSYS2 development environment, which gives us access to the MingGW-w64 toolchain. Since this toolchain allows glscopeclient to be compiled as a native Windows application, MSYS2 is only needed to actually compile the project, not to run it.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download and install MSYS2. You can download it here: \url{https://www.msys2.org/}\\
It is of utmost importance that \textbf{all} steps outlined on the website are followed precisely, even if they might seem unnecessary. This will avoid lots of hard to diagnose problems later on in the build.\\

All following steps are to be done in a MinGW64 shell (\textbf{not} in a MSYS shell, which also gets installed by the MSYS2 installer).

\item Install build tools
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-make
\end{lstlisting}

\item Install dependencies
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glm mingw-w64-x86_64-libsigc++ \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm3 mingw-w64-x86_64-yaml-cpp \
    mingw-w64-x86_64-glew
\end{lstlisting}

\item Build FFTS library
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
git clone https://github.com/anthonix/ffts.git
cd ffts
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MSYSTEM_PREFIX \
    -DENABLE_SHARED=ON ..
mingw32-make -j4
mingw32-make install
\end{lstlisting}

The unit tests will not be run as part of this build - if you would like to run them, you will need to provide catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2), and remove the -DBUILD\_TESTING=OFF flag from below.

\item Build scopehal and scopehal-apps
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
git clone https://github.com/azonenberg/scopehal-apps.git --recurse-submodules
cd scopehal-apps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -DLIBFFTS_INCLUDE_DIR=/mingw64/include/ffts \
    -DLIBFFTS_LIBRARIES=/mingw64/lib/libffts_static.a \
    -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF ..
mingw32-make -j4
\end{lstlisting}

\item Copying binaries and running glscopeclient \\
Since glscopeclient is built using the MinGW toolchain, it depends on a rather large number of dynamic libraries. Since the application cannot find these libraries when being run from the build directory, there are two ways to make glscopeclient runnable: copying it into place in the MinGW64 virtual file system, and ``packaging'' the application by collecting all the depedencies.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Installing glscopeclient into the virtual filesystem
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
cp ./src/glscopeclient/glscopeclient.exe /mingw64/bin/
cp -r ./src/glscopeclient/gradients /mingw64/bin/
cp -r ./src/glscopeclient/icons /mingw64/bin/
cp -r ./src/glscopeclient/shaders /mingw64/bin/
cp -r ./src/glscopeclient/styles /mingw64/bin/
cp ./lib/graphwidget/libgraphwidget.dll /mingw64/bin/
cp ./lib/log/liblog.dll /mingw64/bin/
cp ./lib/scopehal/libscopehal.dll /mingw64/bin/
cp ./lib/scopeprotocols/libscopeprotocols.dll /mingw64/bin/
cp -r ./lib/scopeprotocols/kernels /mingw64/bin/
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{0.5cm}
The application can now be started from any MinGW64 terminal session:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
glscopeclient.exe
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Packaging glscopeclient and its depedencies
This approach is not officially supported yet.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Running glscopeclient}

When running glscopeclient with no arguments, a dialog box (Fig. \ref{connection-dialog}) is displayed allowing you to
connect to an instrument. As of this writing, there is no support for connecting to multiple instruments via the
dialog.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{images/connection-dialog.png}
\caption{Connection dialog}
\label{connection-dialog}
\end{figure}

It is also possible to connect to arbitrarily many instruments by passing the ``connection string" for each instrument
as a command-line argument.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
./glscopeclient --debug \
	mylecroy:lecroy:vicp:myscope.example.com:1234 \
	myrigol:rigol:lan:rigol.example.com
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{--debug} argument may be omitted or replaced with any other liblogtools argument for controlling console
debug verbosity (\texttt{--quiet}, \texttt{--verbose}, \texttt{--debug}, \texttt{--trace}, etc). If you're using
glscopeclient at its current level of maturity you're probably a developer, so we suggest \texttt{--debug} by default.

Each instrument is described by a ``connection string" containing four colon-separated fields.

\begin{itemize}
\item Nickname. This can be any text string not containing spaces or colons. If you have only one instrument it's
largely ignored, but when multiple instruments are present channel names in the UI are prefixed with the nickname to
avoid ambiguity.
\item Driver name. This is a string identifying the command protocol the scope uses. Note that not all
scopes from the same vendor will use the same command set or driver!
\item Transport. This is is a string describing how the driver connects to the scope (e.g. RS232 or Ethernet)
\item Arguments for the driver identifying the device to connect to, separated by colons. This varies by driver but is
typically a hostname:port combination, TTY device path, or similar.
\end{itemize}

Some users have reported better performance by setting the OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY environment variable to PASSIVE.

\section{Design Philosophy}

glscopeclient's UI is heavily mouse driven and context based. Space used by always-visible buttons, sliders, etc is
kept to a minimum in order to keep as much screen real estate as possible usable for waveform display. Additional
controls are displayed in menus or pop-up dialogs, then hidden as soon as they are not needed.

Most UI elements can be interacted with by left clicking (select), left dragging (move), using the scroll wheel (zoom),
double clicking (open properties dialog), or right clicking (context menu).

Most text fields allow SI prefixes for scaling values (mV, us, GHz, etc).

\section{Troubleshooting}

\subsection{Poor performance or hangs}

Ensure the OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY environment variable is set to PASSIVE.

\subsection{Corrupted or no graphical output in waveform areas}

Some users have reported problems with libglvnd under Linux. Changing the CMP0072 declaration in
glscopeclient/CMakeLists.txt from NEW to OLD may fix it.
